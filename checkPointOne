1). A (collaborative?) text editor specifically for screenwriting. Including all the basic functionality of a usual text editor save, 
save as, open, copy, paste, and cut along with more delineated usability with functions creating the correct format for action, 
scene breaks, transitions, dialogue, voice overs and  title pages.
2). Having used similar applications in the past I think I have enough of an understanding to improve on what I thought was lacking 
or add what wasn’t there.
3). The plan is to use the swing GUI for the text box and basic functions. Username and password will have to be provided by the user.
Possibility of saving user documents online (FTP? But where to send? Tomcat’s servers?). Two pages possibly three (time permitting)
Login, main page, and maybe script selection if there is an option for saving to an outside server.
